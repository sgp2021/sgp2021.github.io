    <meta property="og:description" content="The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in Geometry Processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections." />

<h3 id="typesetting">Typesetting</h3>
<p>Please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org">https://srmv2.eg.org</a>. SGP 2021 does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP 2021 recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.</p>
<h3 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h3>
<p>Review is based on a double-blind reviewing process, so all submitted papers must be anonymized. Please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person. Reviewers are asked to keep confidentiality on all materials sent to them for evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-your-article">Submitting your article</h3>
<p>Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-submission">Abstract submission</h3>
<p>In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must first be submitted (within the abstract submission deadline — see timeline above).</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-process">Reviewing process</h3>
<p>Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving double-blind
assessment by carefully selected reviewers from the <a href="/organization/#technical-papers-committee">technical papers
committee</a>. Articles are
conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in
the second round, based on the revised version of the article.</p>
<h3 id="proceedings">Proceedings</h3>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in a regular issue of <em>Computer Graphics
Forum</em>, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. <em>Computer
Graphics Forum</em> (Print ISSN: 0167-7055; Online ISSN: 1467-8659) is the official
journal of <em>Eurographics</em>, published in cooperation with Wiley-Blackwell, and is
one of the leading journals for researchers, developers and users of Computer
Graphics in both commercial and academic environment. It has one of the highest
impact factors in the field, and it is indexed by all major databases;
additionally, the electronic version of all accepted work will also be indexed
and accessible by the EG Digital Library.</p>
