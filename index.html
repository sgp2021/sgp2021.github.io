        The <i>Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)</i> is the premier
        venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in
        Geometry Processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics,
        computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new
        insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling,
        analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D
        models and shape collections.

	<h2>Submission</h2>

<p><b>Preparing your article:</b>	
	SGP 2021 welcomes articles on all covered topics; see the Call for Papers for additional details.</p>

<p><b>Typesetting:</b> please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: https://srmv2.eg.org.</p>

<p><b>Paper Length:</b> SGP 2021 does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP 2021 recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.</p>

<p><b>Anonymization:</b> review is based on a double-blind reviewing process, so all submitted papers must be anonymized. Please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person. Reviewers are asked to keep confidentiality on all materials sent to them for evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Submitting your article:</b>
	Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system.</p>

<p><b>Abstract submission:</b> In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must first be submitted (within the abstract submission deadline — see timeline above).</p>

<p><b>Reviewing process:</b> Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving double-blind assessment by carefully selected reviewers. Articles are conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in the second round, based on the revised version of the article.</p>

<p><b>Proceedings:</b> Accepted papers will be published in a regular issue of Computer Graphics Forum (CGForum), the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. CGForum (Print ISSN: 0167-7055; Online ISSN: 1467-8659) is the official journal of Eurographics, published in cooperation with Wiley-Blackwell, and is one of the leading journals for researchers, developers and users of Computer Graphics in both commercial and academic environment. It has one of the highest impact factors in the field, and it is indexed by all major databases; additionally, the electronic version of all accepted work will also be indexed and accessible by the EG Digital Library.</p>

<p><b>Presentation at SGP 2021:</b> Coming soon.</p>
