-  Simulation and animation
-  Smoothing, filtering, and denoising
-  Surface and volume parameterization and deformation

### Typesetting

Please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: https://srmv2.eg.org. SGP 2021 does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP 2021 recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.

### Anonymization

Review is based on a double-blind reviewing process, so all submitted papers must be anonymized. Please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person. Reviewers are asked to keep confidentiality on all materials sent to them for evaluation.

### Submitting your article

Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system.

### Abstract submission

In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must first be submitted (within the abstract submission deadline â€” see timeline above).

### Reviewing process

Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving double-blind
assessment by carefully selected reviewers from the [technical papers
committee](/organization/#technical-papers-committee). Articles are
conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in
the second round, based on the revised version of the article.

### Anonymity and Preprints

For the first time this year, we are adopting the same policy as SIGGRAPH (which is similar to CVPR) on preprints, including those shared via arXiv.  Following this policy almost verbatim, we recognize that prepublications and talks have become part of the scientific discourse, and SGP allows these means of communication. Specifically, before the final acceptance decision is made:

- Authors must not discuss the research described in submitted SGP papers with the media. Media includes editors/journalists/writers/interviewers of newspapers, radio, television, magazines, as well as public relations and media arms of companies, universities, and other research institutions.
- After submitting to SGP, authors may archive the submission without mentioning SGP as an institutional tech report or on arXiv or a similar service.
- Authors must not make any posts to social media or elsewhere that can be linked to a specific SGP submission (e.g., mentioning the title of the submission or details and content and saying that it is a SGP submission).
- Authors may talk about their work in a presentation without saying it is submitted to SGP.
- Authors may mention their submission(s) as under review at SGP as part of the written materials submitted for job and funding applications. Authors may talk about the research involved in their submission in talks given for these purposes as well, without mentioning SGP.

### Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published in a regular issue of _Computer Graphics
Forum_, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. _Computer
Graphics Forum_ (Print ISSN: 0167-7055; Online ISSN: 1467-8659) is the official
journal of _Eurographics_, published in cooperation with Wiley-Blackwell, and is
one of the leading journals for researchers, developers and users of Computer
Graphics in both commercial and academic environment. It has one of the highest
impact factors in the field, and it is indexed by all major databases;
additionally, the electronic version of all accepted work will also be indexed
and accessible by the EG Digital Library.
